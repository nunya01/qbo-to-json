# qbo-to-json
Simple Python tool for windows to convert quicken QBO files to JSON.
Quicken disabled my Home & Business software because they decided it was now SaaS. Whatevs.
I decided to make my own little financial program tat allowed me to still download QBO files from my bank and see the bare necessities.
This portion of code imports the QBO and exports as JSON.
